hi sda i assume you can scratch

start by placing a microcontroller at the top left corner of your signs  
scale it as the same size as your signs  
use your scale tool or check the studio properties, your signs should all have the same y and z size  
cover the signs in ethernet or cjoint them, find one way or another to connect the signs to the micro  

arrange signs left to right to complete strings, numbers, variables, or syntaxes and functions  

for passing arguments, cover signs with signs containing your desired values  
multiple signs can be passed in the same indent such as accessing list elements  

there should be signs laid out for use  
anything not included should probably be passed as strings or numbers
